When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I want my project to be shared or when I want to have an additional copy of my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might need to make many commits on my local repository and then push them all to my remote repository. This allow me to work
without an internet connection. I might also want to update my remote once a logical unit of work is complete. This could be after
having more than one commit on my local repository.
