When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I would want to use a remote repository when I want my project to be shared or when I want to have an additional copy of my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might need to make many commits on my local repository and then push them all to my remote repository. This allow me to work
without an internet connection. I might also want to update my remote once a logical unit of work is complete. This could be after
having more than one commit on my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of a repository made on github.com. A clone is also a copy of a repository, but this could be done on any computer with
git on it. A branch is a group of commits related. In a branch all its commits are reachable from the tip.
